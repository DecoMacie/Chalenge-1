# <Challenge 1>

## Description

Challenge is designed to prepare you for two scenarios that you will encounter as a developer:

On-the-job tickets or feature requests

Job-seeking coding assessments

On-the-job ticket challenge will provide you with starter code. You’ll modify or add to this code to complete the challenge.

Job-seeking coding assessments do not provide starter code. You’ll build these from scratch.

All of the challenge assignments follow agile project management conventions, providing a user story, acceptance criteria, a mock-up demonstrating the application functionality, and review guidelines.
